# Row Grouping

Row Grouping is an enterprise feature. It allows a tree virtualisation of data and the various configuration options for Row Grouping allow control over the values in the tree, having columns only represent leaf nodes rather than root nodes and even custom rendering.

The documentation for Row Grouping is available here:

## Video Tutorial

The video tutorial shows the content in JavaScript. Because the configuration is achieved through column and grid properties it should be a simple matter to map on to your existing understanding of AG Grid with React.
